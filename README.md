## üõ†Ô∏è **Setup Instructions**  

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Programmer-govind/Breakout-AI-Agent-Project.git
   cd Breakout-AI-Agent-Project
   ```  

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**  
   ```bash  
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: cd venv\Scripts\
   activate 
   ```  

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

4. ### **Setup Environment Variables**

   Follow these steps to securely manage API keys and other sensitive information using a `.env` file:

   #### 1. **Install Required Library**
   Use `python-dotenv` to load environment variables from a `.env` file into your Python application:
   ```bash
   pip install python-dotenv
   ```

   #### 2. **Create a `.env` File**
   In the root directory of the project, create a file named `.env`. Add your API keys and other sensitive configurations inside    the file:
   ```
   SERP_API_KEY=your_serp_api_key
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE=credentials.json
   ```

   #### 3. **Use Environment Variables in Your Code**
   In your `app.py` file, load the `.env` file and access the variables using the `os` module:
   ```python
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   import os

   # Load environment variables from the .env file
   load_dotenv()

   # Access the variables
   SERP_API_KEY = os.getenv("SERP_API_KEY")
   GROQ_API_KEY = os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY")
   GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE = os.getenv("GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE")
   ```

5. **Run the Application**  
   ```bash  
   streamlit run app.py  
   ```  

6. **Access the Dashboard**  
   Open your browser and navigate to:  
   ```  
   http://localhost:8501  
   ```
